                    <h3>From Supervised Learning to Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                    <p>This is the third and final course from the Machine Learning series: <b>Unsupervised Learning and
                            Recommender Systems.</b> In this post, I seek to organize and extract the most essential
                        part from the mentioned course and notes taught by Andrew. Let's dive in!</p>
                    <p>Unsupervised learning stands apart from its supervised counterpart in a fundamental way: it
                        doesn't rely on labeled data. Instead, it seeks to uncover hidden patterns and structures within
                        datasets, making it an invaluable tool for exploratory data analysis and feature learning.</p>

                    <p>In the unsupervised learning paradigm, we're presented with a training set of unlabeled examples,
                        \(\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, ..., x^{(m)}\}\). The goal is to find some structure or patterns
                        in
                        this data without the guidance of predefined labels.</p>

                    <h3>Clustering: Unveiling Hidden Structures</h3>
                    <p>Clustering is a cornerstone technique in unsupervised learning. It aims to group similar data
                        points together while separating dissimilar ones. Among clustering algorithms, K-means stands
                        out for its simplicity and effectiveness.</p>

                <div id="k-means" class="section">
                    <h3>K-means Algorithm</h3>

                    <p>The K-means algorithm is an iterative process that seeks to partition \(n\) observations into
                        \(K\) clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid).
                        Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Initialization: Randomly initialize \(K\) cluster centroids, \(\{\mu_1, \mu_2, ...,
                            \mu_K\}\)</li>
                        <li>Repeat until convergence:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Assign points to clusters:
                                    <pre><code>For i = 1 to m:
                c^(i) := index (from 1 to K) of cluster centroid closest to x^(i)</code></pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>Move cluster centroids:
                                    <pre><code>For k = 1 to K:
                Î¼_k := average (mean) of points assigned to cluster k</code></pre>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><img src="../images/AndrewML3/1-2-K-means algorithm visualization.png" alt="K-means algorithm visualization"></p>

                    <p>The algorithm continues to iterate until the assignments no longer change significantly or a
                        maximum number of iterations is reached.</p>

                <div id="optimization-objective" class="section">
                    <h3>Optimization Objective</h3>

                    <p>The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the following cost function:</p>

                    <p>\[J(c^{(1)}, ..., c^{(m)}, \mu_1, ..., \mu_K) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m ||x^{(i)} -
                        \mu_{c^{(i)}}||^2\]</p>

                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>\(c^{(i)}\) is the index of the cluster to which example \(x^{(i)}\) is currently assigned
                        </li>
                        <li>\(\mu_k\) is the centroid of cluster k</li>
                        <li>\(\mu_{c^{(i)}}\) is the cluster centroid of the cluster to which example \(x^{(i)}\) has
                            been
                            assigned</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This cost function represents the average squared distance between data points and their assigned
                        cluster centroids. The algorithm seeks to minimize this cost, thereby creating tighter, more
                        coherent clusters.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing the Number of Clusters (K)</h3>
                    <p>One of the challenges in applying K-means is determining the optimal number of clusters. Two
                        common approaches are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elbow Method: Plot the cost function \(J\) against the number of clusters \(K\). The "elbow"
                            in
                            the
                            resulting curve often indicates a good choice for \(K\).</li>
                        <li>Purpose-driven Selection: Choose \(K\) based on the downstream purpose of the clustering.
                            For
                            example, in T-shirt sizing, you might choose \(K=5\) for XS, S, M, L, XL sizes.</li>

                    <h4>Anomaly Detection:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very small number of positive (anomalous) examples</li>

                            log(x+1), or \(\sqrt{x}\) to make them more Gaussian-like.</li>

                            monitoring, you might create features like:
                            <p>\[x_5 = \frac{\text{CPU load}}{\text{network traffic}}\]
                                \[x_6 = \frac{(\text{CPU load})^2}{\text{network traffic}}\]</p>

                        digital experiences. From suggesting movies on Netflix to product recommendations on Amazon,

                    <h4>Predicting Movie Ratings</h4>
                    <p>The journey begins with a fundamental problem: predicting movie ratings. Consider a matrix where
                        rows represent movies, columns represent users, and each cell contains a rating (or is empty if
                        the user hasn't rated that movie).</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>\(n_u\): number of users</li>
                        <li>\(n_m\): number of movies</li>
                        <li>\(r(i,j)\): 1 if user \(j\) has rated movie \(i\), 0 otherwise</li>
                        <li>\(y^{(i,j)}\): rating given by user \(j\) to movie \(i\) (defined only if \(r(i,j)=1\))</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Mars Rover Example</h4>

                    <p>Consider a Mars rover navigating a grid-like environment:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>States: Different positions on the grid</li>
                        <li>Actions: Move left or right</li>
                        <li>Rewards: Positive for reaching the goal, negative for dangerous areas</li>
                        <li>Terminal states: Goal positions or dangerous areas</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Concept of Return</h4>

                    <p>The return is the cumulative reward an agent receives, often with future rewards discounted:</p>

                    <p>\[\text{Return} = R_1 + \gamma R_2 + \gamma^2 R_3 + ...\]</p>

                    <p>Where:</p>

                        <li>\(\gamma\) is the discount factor (0 â¤ Î³ â¤ 1)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The discount factor determines how much the agent values future rewards compared to immediate
                        ones.</p>

                    <h4>Policies in Reinforcement Learning</h4>

                    <p>A policy Ï is a function that maps states to actions, telling the agent what to do in each state.
                        The goal of RL is to find an optimal policy Ï* that maximizes the expected return.</p>

                    <h4>The State-Action Value Function (Q-function)</h4>

                    <p>The Q-function Q(s, a) represents the expected return starting from state s, taking action a, and
                        then following the optimal policy thereafter:</p>

                    <p>\[Q(s, a) = \mathbb{E}[R_1 + \gamma R_2 + \gamma^2 R_3 + ... | s_0 = s, a_0 = a]\]</p>

                    <h4>The Bellman Equation</h4>

                    <p>The Bellman equation is a fundamental concept in RL that relates the value of a state-action pair
                        to the value of subsequent states:</p>

                    <p>\[Q(s, a) = R(s) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')\]</p>

                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>R(s) is the immediate reward in state s</li>
                        <li>s' is the next state after taking action a in state s</li>
                        <li>\(\gamma\) is the discount factor</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Learning Algorithm</h4>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Initialize the Q-network with random weights</li>
                        <li>Collect experience tuples (s, a, R(s), s') by interacting with the environment</li>
                        <li>Store these experiences in a replay buffer</li>
                        <li>Sample mini-batches from the replay buffer</li>
                        <li>Train the network to minimize the loss:
                            <p>\[L = (R(s) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a))^2\]</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Periodically update the target network used for computing the target Q-values</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Improvements to the Basic Algorithm</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Îµ-greedy Policy: With probability Îµ, choose a random action; otherwise, choose the action
                            with the highest Q-value. This balances exploration and exploitation.</li>
                        <li>Experience Replay: Use a buffer of past experiences to break correlations between
                            consecutive training samples and stabilize learning.</li>
                        <li>Soft Updates: Instead of directly copying weights to the target network, use a weighted
                            average:
                            <p>\[\theta_\text{target} = \tau \theta + (1-\tau) \theta_\text{target}\]</p>
                            Where Ï is a small value (e.g., 0.001)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Limitations and Future Directions</h3>

                    <p>While reinforcement learning has shown impressive results in simulated environments and games, it
                        faces challenges in real-world applications:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sample Inefficiency: RL often requires many interactions with the environment to learn
                            effectively.</li>
                        <li>Stability and Reproducibility: Training can be unstable and sensitive to hyperparameters.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reward Design: Crafting appropriate reward functions for complex tasks can be challenging.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sim-to-Real Transfer: Policies learned in simulation may not transfer well to real-world
                            scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Despite these challenges, RL remains an exciting area of research with potential applications in
                        robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making processes.</p>
